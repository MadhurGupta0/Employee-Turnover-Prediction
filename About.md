# Employee Turnover Prediction

This project focuses on predicting employee turnover using machine learning models. We compare the performance of Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers on a hypothetical dataset. The data includes features such as satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, and more. The models are trained, evaluated, and their accuracies are compared using visualizations. Additionally, the trained model can be saved and loaded for future predictions, making it practical for real-world applications.

## How Prediction Works in Python
### Data Preparation:
- Collect Data: Gather the data you want to use for prediction. This could be from a CSV file, a database, or any other source.
- Clean Data: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and clean the data to ensure it’s ready for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the model’s performance.
- Split Data: Divide the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
### Model Training:
- Choose a Model: Select a machine learning algorithm that suits your problem (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
- Train the Model: Use the training data to train the model. This involves feeding the data into the algorithm and allowing it to learn the patterns and relationships within the data.
### Model Evaluation:
- Make Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on the testing data.
- Evaluate Performance: Assess the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. This helps you understand how well the model is performing and whether it can generalize to new data.
### Model Deployment:
- Save the Model: Save the trained model to a file using libraries like joblib or pickle. This allows you to load the model later without retraining it.
- Load the Model: Load the saved model when you need to make predictions on new data.
- Make Predictions: Use the loaded model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how the Employee Turnover Prediction project:

### Step 1: Import Libraries
We start by importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation. These include pandas for data handling, numpy for numerical operations, scikit-learn for machine learning models, matplotlib for plotting, and joblib for saving and loading models.

### Step 2: Create Hypothetical Data
We generate a hypothetical dataset with features relevant to employee turnover. This dataset includes various attributes such as satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent at the company, work accidents, promotions, department, and salary.

### Step 3: Preprocess Data
We preprocess the data by converting categorical variables (like department and salary) into numerical dummy variables. This step is crucial because machine learning models typically require numerical input. We also separate the features (independent variables) from the target variable (dependent variable), which indicates whether an employee has left the company.

### Step 4: Split Data
We split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the machine learning models, while the testing set is used to evaluate their performance. This helps ensure that the models can generalize well to new, unseen data.

### Step 5: Train Models
We train two different machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Logistic Regression is a linear model used for binary classification, while Random Forest is an ensemble model that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and control overfitting.

### Step 6: Evaluate Models
We evaluate the performance of both models using metrics such as accuracy and classification reports. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances, while the classification report provides detailed insights into the model’s performance, including precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Step 7: Save and Load Model
We save the trained model using joblib, which allows us to load and use the model for predictions without retraining it. This is particularly useful for deploying the model in a production environment or sharing it with others.
