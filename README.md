Introduction
Employee turnover prediction is crucial for organizations to retain talent and reduce costs associated with hiring and training new employees. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether an employee will leave the company based on various features.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-turnover-prediction.git
cd employee-turnover-prediction

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the script to train the models and evaluate their performance:

The script will output the accuracy and classification report for both Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
Models and Evaluation
Logistic Regression
Trained using the LogisticRegression class from sklearn.linear_model.
Evaluated using accuracy score and classification report.
Random Forest
Trained using the RandomForestClassifier class from sklearn.ensemble.
Evaluated using accuracy score and classification report.
Dependencies
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
joblib
Results
The results of the model evaluations will be displayed in the console, including accuracy scores and classification reports. Additionally, a bar chart comparing the accuracy of both models will be generated.
